# Github-Automated-Analysis

In this project, I've built a Python-based tool that, takes the user's GitHub user id as input and returns the full name of the user name and repository, complexity score, and complexity analysis for each repository.

It also performs well if the repository exceeds the token limit and gives a description of the same.
